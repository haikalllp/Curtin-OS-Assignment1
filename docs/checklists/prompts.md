# Checklists:
Create a very very very detailed markdown checklist of all of the stories for this project plan, with one-story-point tasks (with unchecked checkboxes) that break down each story. It is critically important that all of the details to implement this are in this list. Note that a very competent AI Coding Agent will be using this list to autonomously create this application, so be sure not to miss any details whatsoever, no matter how much time and thinking you must do to complete this very challenging but critically important task.

# Coder Prompt:
Go through each story and task in the yourtask.md file. Find the next story to work on. Review each unfinished task, correct any issues or ask for clarifications (only if absolutely needed!). Then proceed to create or edit files to complete each task. After you complete all the tasks in the story, update the file to check off any completed tasks. Run builds and commits after each story. Run all safe commands without asking for approval. Continue with each task until you have finished the story, then stop and wait for me to review.
